# Carcompare

**what is this?.**

This is an app for compare price of cars across Europe, is tougth for car dealers, flippers or somebody who want to buy a good car for a fair price.

Maybe the more probable use case is a spanish dealer who import cars from Germany, Austria and Netherlands in this case the diference in price is considerable, also the cars are in a better shape, and well maintened.

**this app is just for use in linux .**

open the folder carcompare-linux-64 -> grab the file 'carcompare' and drop it in the linux terminal, then press enter.

if you want to use it in win or mac you need to clone the repo, install electron and then run 'npm start'

The screen size is optmized for my laptop screen 1848 x 1053.

if your screen is smaller maybe the experience is not ideal, just adjust manualy the size of each window.

**How to use it.**

choose the language -

choose the countries for the search in the menu on top of the app.

navigate the left window using the UI of autoscout24, filter by brand, model, year, km etc.

if you are interested in a, car click on it to check the specs, you can translate the description with 'translate desciption' button on the app menu.

the rigth window is gonna display the same search but in your choosed country.

to go back to the list use 'go back' button on the menu app.

#Happy importing, I will love to see the pics of your new BMW :D

**opening the umbrella before start to rain.**
This was my first app, before this i just did static web.
So I know the code is not not well structured, I should make a huge refactor and maybe separate it in some files, alse there is a bug i need to take care. maybe one day...
